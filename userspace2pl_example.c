// The purpose this test is to show that users can get to devices in user
// mode for simple things like GPIO. This is not to say this should replace
// a kernel driver, but does provide some short term solutions sometimes
// or a debug solution that can be helpful.

// This test maps a GPIO in the hardware into the user space such that a
// GPIO signal can be toggled fast. On the ML507 reference system, the 
// signal could be toggled about every 50 ns which is pretty fast.

// This test was derived from devmem2.c.
